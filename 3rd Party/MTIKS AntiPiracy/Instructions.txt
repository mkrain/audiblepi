Installation Instructions for Windows Phone 7 Apps

These instructions are assuming that you are using Visual Studio (with Windows Phone 7 Tools & C# as the language) to build your project. Please follow the instructions below to integrate mtiks library into your existing development project.

Create a new application in the portal and get a new code for the new app
Download our library from the portal
Requirements: .NET Framework 4, Windows Phone 7 Tools
Add a reference to System.Reflection if you don't have it already
Please make sure that you have these capabilities in your WP7AppManifest.xml or WMAppManifest.XML. Otherwise, you will get UnauthorizedAccessException. You can find this file under Properties folder of your App Solution.
 <Capability Name="ID_CAP_IDENTITY_DEVICE"/>

Reference app from your windows phone 7 project
Declare the namespace as "using com.mtiks.winmobile;"
At the beginning of Application_Launching and Application_Activated, add the following line: 
 mtiks.Instance.Start("YOUR_APP_KEY", Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
				

YOUR_APP_KEY is the code generated from the Apps page after you create an app. If you copied it, paste it in place of YOUR_APP_KEY.
Include the following statement at the beginning of "Application_Closing" and Application_Deactivated, add the following line 
 mtiks.Instance.Stop();
				
If you would like to track custom events and attributes within your app (more info here): 
 mtiks.Instance.postEventAttributes("Event Name", "Attribute List in Dictionary strings");
				
If you like to track your app exceptions from runtime, please use the following 
 mtiks.Instance.AddException(
		@"description"
 );
