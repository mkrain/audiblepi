      About Pi
      You can find information about Pi here:

      Playing 12 Standard Notes
      In order to play the 12 standards notes
      ( C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B ), the 
      decimal equivalent of Pi must be converted 
      into duodecimal or base 12.  The application
      takes a shortcut as converting such a precise 
      number with imprecise datatypes is difficult.  
      Instead the application takes each grouping of 5
      digits as they are calculated and converts those 
      to base 12.  What gets played are these 
      "pseudo"-base 12 digits.

      How it works
      Playing the calculated pi value
      - Simply click one of the three visible notes and the sound will play.
      - If you want the notes to play continuously press the play button the notes will play until you reach the end, unless you have 'loop sound' selected.
      - Press the previous arrow to return the the previous note, based on the skip amount.
      - Similarly press the next arrow to advance the notes by the skip amount.
      - You can play notes at the same time they are being auto played.
      - Click on the instrument icon on the main menu to cycle through them.

      Use The Settings Menu
      The settings menu is your friend you can customize much of the app there
      - Instrument: Let the fun began, violin is awesome but use the one you want.
      - Prev/Next Skip: When using auto or manual advance this many digits will be skipped.
      - Tempo : In milliseconds, time between each sound, try 125ms for furious mode!
      - # Pi Digits: number of digits to calculate, more digits means more time.
      - Loop Sound: When on, digits are continually played, looping at the end.
      - Precomputed Digits: This will switch from calculated digits to precomputed digits.
